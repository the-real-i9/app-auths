# Build Story

Think of this document as a live narration (or, a reality show) of my journey while I build this project. It's so detailed it's gonna look like you're here watching me. You could relate the experience to watching a programming-based Hollywood series or movie; but, in this case, it's a story or novel. If you don't seem to be enjoying this, raise an issue ðŸ˜œ.
